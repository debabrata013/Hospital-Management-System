# 🏥 Room Management System - Complete Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

The room management system has been completely updated to use the database instead of mock data. **All data will now persist and won't disappear when you refresh the page!**

## 📋 What's Fixed

✅ **Rooms API** - Now saves to database  
✅ **Cleaning API** - Now saves to database  
✅ **Room Assignments** - Now saves to database  
✅ **Patient Data** - Now persists in database  
✅ **Cleaning Tasks** - Now saved permanently  
✅ **Staff Assignments** - Now tracked in database  

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Complete Setup Script

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd Hospital-Management-System

# Run the complete room management setup
node scripts/setup-room-management-complete.js
```

This script will:
- Create all necessary database tables
- Insert sample data (rooms, patients, cleaning staff)
- Set up proper relationships between tables
- Configure indexes for optimal performance

### Step 2: Verify Database Connection

Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct database credentials:

```bash
DB_HOST=srv2047.hstgr.io
DB_USER=u153229971_admin
DB_PASSWORD=Admin!2025
DB_NAME=u153229971_Hospital
DB_PORT=3306
```

## 🏗️ Database Schema
